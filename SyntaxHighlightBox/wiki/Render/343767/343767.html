<div class="wikidoc"><h1>WPF SyntaxHighlightBox</h1>
<b>.NET version</b> : created under 4.0.0, not tested with previous releases<br /><b>Language</b> : WPF / C#<br /><br />SyntaxHighlightBox is a project to build a fast textbox with support for easy-to-configure syntax highlighting.<br />Source code is quite simple and rather small, so feel free to modify it to suit your needs.<br />Syntaxes are described in XML files and support a wide range of patterns.<br /><br /><b>Highlighting is done by block increment and asynchronously !</b> As a result, working with a 100.000 line file is as fast as it could be.<br /><br />Please keep in mind that I developed this only for fast prototyping of different applications that could use a syntax highlighter, and as a result I&#39;m not sure that it is ready for production purposes. Anyway, do not hesitate to propose any bug-fix or code improvement.<br /><br /><img src="cbox1.png" alt="cbox1.png" title="cbox1.png" /><br /><br /><br /><br />Here is an example of syntax description file. Syntaxes currently supports 3 different rules (each rule can be included more than once to cover everything of course) :<br /><br />- <b>HighlightWordsRule</b> : list of words that will be highlighted using the given decorations.<br />- <b>HighlightLineRule</b> : give it a line starting pattern and it will highlight and as well as the rest of the line.<br />- <b>AdvancedHighlightRule</b> : takes a (C# style) Regular Expression as parameter and highlights it using the given decoration attributes.<br /><br /><br /><br /><img src="cbox2.png" alt="cbox2.png" title="cbox2.png" /></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
